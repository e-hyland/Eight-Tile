For this assignment, only I looked at, or graded the work.

I did it something like this :
*) I put your work into one of a number of "bins" were the
work seemed of a similar standard, taking into account extensions etc.
*) I then gave each of these "bins" a mark.
*) I went through each piece of work again, checking if it should move
up/down to a different bin.
*) Some comments (lines too long etc.) were generated automagically.
*) I added some comments manually.

Some of the negative comments have the following key :
[ALLOC] Every malloc/calloc() needs to have a corresponding free().
[C99] Code won't compile using the -ansi flag: often // comments or similar.
[CAPDEFS] It's traditional make #define's in C using capitals #define MAX, not #define max. 
[FOPEN] For every fopen() there should be an fclose().
[FPRINTF] On exit/error, fprintf(stdeerr, ...) not via stdout & printf().
[GLOB] Use of a global variable.
[LINELEN] Line too long to read easily.
[LONGFUNC] Function has too many lines to make it easily readable/understandable.
[MAGICNUM] Use #defines, enums etc., rather than using magic numbers (e.g. if(x >= 39 is bad)
[NESTING] Too many nested if/for/else etc to make the code easily understandable.
kNOBRACE] if/else/for etc. with no brace.
[WARNING WRONGLY DISABLED] You've deliberately disabled one of the compiler warnings !?
[WARN] Warning produced by the gcc compiler.

Some self-documentation e.g. an enumeration or typedef that I particularly enjoyed.
[ENUMTYPEDEF]


Marks correspond to the following bands:
70%+ : Above what I was expecting at this stage in the unit
60%+ : Good coding, putting into practice what we're lecturing.
50%+ : Code is probably working, but doesn't follow house-style, or part 3/etension missing.


Generally:
*) Don't assume your executable is called "eighttile". Someone may have renamed it, or rebuilt it as something else. In any usage tips, use argv[0] instead.

*) You need to pay real attention to the names of functions etc. - some are clearly misnamed. Look at them when you've finished & see if an additional comment would be helpful.

*) Don't put in unnecessary comments e.g. /* The next line is main() */   It makes me think you
don't know what is obvious to the reader & what is not ...

*) Don't leave large chunks of code that you've used for debugging and then commented out - if you really want to, put a #ifdef DEBUG or similar around them.

*) If you're using an external source for ideas (e.g. telling when a board is solvable or not), cite it in some way, inside the code.

*) In this exercise, where speed is more of an issue, functions which compare two boards should stop comparing as soon as anything is different, and return 0. Many people simply set a flag and kept comparing, even though, by then it wasn't necessary.

*) The use of ncurses was supposed to make the display of the solution nicer for the user - this was often not the case here - weird stripes and garish colours abounded :-) There's also an interest optical illusion whereby choosing the wrong colour makes it look like the *space* has moved, not a tile (maybe it's just me !?)

*) Many people are #define-ing many error codes for exit on file failure, malloc failure etc. Seems like a perfect opportunity to enumerate them instead ?

*) If you have a source file with an associated header file, it's normal to give them the same name e.g. eighttile.c eighttile.h

*) Even when printing out the board with ncurses, you should still allow the user to abort early via some event - some people simply forced the user to sit through the entire thing, even if pressing ESC.

*) Part three was to do with creating a dyanmic data structure (next poiinters etc.) Some people used realloc() (which I haven't lectured) to simply resize a 1D array. This is not the same. You've no reason to use realloc().




Comments for you
----------------


Feedback, mainly for final8tile.c
[LONGFUNC]  1 Long Function(s), longest is 123 lines
[LINELEN] Line too long ? Characters = 102 void copynumber(char number[HEIGHT][WIDTH], char final[SCREEN_ROWS][SCREEN_COLS], int colus, int rows)
Part 1 = 50 (/70)
NCurses = 8 (/10)
Part 3 = 6 (/10)
Extension = 6 (/10)
Initial Mark = 63
Final Mark = 70
[FINALCOMMENT] Code too repetitive in explore(). The font data could be #included. Nice overall!
